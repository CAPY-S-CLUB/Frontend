## üöÄ The Problem

Luxury brands struggle to create loyalty programs that reflect the exclusivity and sense of ownership their clients value. Traditional email lists and point-based systems are generic and do not offer a true digital asset that the customer can own. There is a missing bridge between owning a luxury product and participating in its digital community.

## ‚ú® The Solution: Capys Club on Stellar

Capys Club offers a SaaS solution that transforms community participation into an experience based on digital asset ownership. By leveraging the speed and scalability of the **Stellar network** and its new **Soroban** smart contracts, we empower brands to issue **"Membership Cards"** and **"Achievement Badges"** as native assets directly to their clients' wallets. This creates a verifiable, efficient, and low-cost ecosystem for engagement.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features (Hackathon MVP Scope)

This prototype focuses on the user journey of a member within a luxury yacht brand's community.

#### 1. **Exclusive Access via Stellar Wallet (FE-01)**
   - Direct connection to the platform using wallets from the Stellar ecosystem (Freighter, Albedo, etc.).
   - Ownership of a specific membership asset is the sole requirement to access the portal.

#### 2. **The VIP Member Dashboard (FE-02)**
   - **Asset Gallery:** An elegant interface that displays the main membership asset and a collection of achievement badges, all issued on the Stellar network.
   - **Token-Gated Content:** Access to premium content sections (news, events) that are unlocked only for holders of the membership asset.

#### 3. **The Brand Management Panel (FE-03)**
   - **Access Issuance:** A tool for the brand administrator to issue a new membership asset directly to a VIP client's Stellar wallet address.
   - **Rewards System:** The ability to distribute badges (digital assets) as a reward for engagement, thereby strengthening customer loyalty.
